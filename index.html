	<h3>Hello Everyone and Weclome to My Webpage! </h3>

	<h3>About me: </h3>

	<p1>Hi I'm an avid non-fiction reader, love to learn and watch comedy movies whenever I'm not busy. <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_New_Earth" >One of my favorite non-fiction book is called "A New Earth by Eckhart Tolle" </a>. A New Earth is my favorite read because the author Eckhart Tolle goes in depth about ones self-esteem and the power of being in the present moment. I often struggle with being in the present moment and find myself worrying about the things I can't control and this book has helped me. </p1> 

	<p2> I'm big on self-education and constanlty push myself to learn new things. Learning or being exposed to new concepts and ideas makes me happy. Once I learn something new I like to share it with other immidiatley and find excitment in doing so. The only genre or type of movies that I enjoy wathcing is comedy. I'm not a fan of any action or horror movies because the hero or the potential victim always makes it out of their dangerous situation alive and the entire movie is predicatble and boring. </p2>
